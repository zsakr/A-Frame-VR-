# A-Frame-VR-
Solar System Project

The purpose of this project is to get more practice with A-Frame to develop a VR application.
Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that uses head-mounted headsets with displays to generate realistic images, 
sounds, and other sensations to put users into an immersive virtual environment. 
VR allows us to create unbounded worlds that people can walk around and interact with using their hands,
to feel as if they were transported to another place.
It’s still considered the wild west of the tech industry⁠—fun, exciting, bustling of opportunities and things are looking very promising.

    WebXR and A-Frame
WebXR is an API that allows developers to create XR experiences; a catch-all term that spans virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), 
and newly-developed immersive technologies.

In this course, we will learn about A-Frame, an easy-to-get-started tool that uses WebXR to gain access to VR headset sensor data (position, orientation, etc.)
to transform the camera and to render content directly to VR headsets.
The cool part is, it works on the browser, too! This means that we don’t need to have a VR headset to build and play with a VR environment.

    Description of the project 
Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

But what would your solar system look like?

In this project, we will add textures, sky, texts, animations, and more in index.html.

Note: This is part 2 of a cumulative project in three parts. In parts 2 & 3, we will add textures and animations to the solar system.
